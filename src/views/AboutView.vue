    <p class="about-paragraph">
      Jiji Treats Bakery and Cakes was born from the heart of a woman with an
      extraordinary passion for cooking and an even greater love for sharing joy
      through food. Jiji, the founder and creative mind behind the brand, is a
      self-taught baker whose dedication, talent, and curiosity have shaped her
      into an exceptional cake artist. From an early age, Jiji found comfort and
      inspiration in the kitchen. What started as a personal hobby soon
      transformed into a deeper calling—one that she chose to pursue with
      determination and heart.
