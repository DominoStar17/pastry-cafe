### Global SCSS Setup

Global styles are maintained in `src/assets/styles.scss`. This file is imported in `src/main.js` so that all styles are applied across the application.

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Git Workflow

- **Development Branch (dev):**  
  All active development occurs on the `dev` branch.
- **Stable Branch (main):**  
  Merge into `main` only when the project is stable and ready for deployment.
- **Pull Requests:**  
  Use PRs to merge changes from `dev` into `main`.
